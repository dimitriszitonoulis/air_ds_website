// TODO in checkLoginErrors.js 
        maybe redirect to my home and have a message there
        BETTER: do not redirect. Show message on top of login screen and the nlet user decide on their own

FIXME
for some reason in getFlightDates.js even though I call the validateSubmitTime function with the validatore

FIXME
in getFlightDates change the name of the sent json to match the names of the fields
(change dep and dest  -> departure-airport, destination-airport like the name in home.php,
it is not necessary to do that but it will be more uniform).
Do the same on all api calls by the funtion...


TODO 
- in AIR_DS_WEBSITE\server\database\services\reservations\db_get_flight_dates.php
        this will be the file containing utils for the reservations, change file name (it is referenced by \api\reservation\get_flight_dates.php)
- change date selection so that unavailable dates do not show
- FIX CSS
- When sending the data for the booking maybe sent a json of jsons where the little jsons contain user information
 validate the big json and the after getting the result that it is valid extract the little ones and loop over them and call validate_fields()

- Maybe add check to all ajax endpoints that decoded content is array
if something is not array then array_keys() fails
- in db_get_flight_info, in db_get_airport_information() maybe make it return more stuff about the airports like their names 
which will be needed for the last interface






// FIXME start_session.php:
/**
* it may cause problems beacause it is not in function
* So when I use require_once it runs only the first time
* If I want to run it multple times, I should put it inside a fucntion and call it everytime
*/


General improvements:
hash passwords
certain amount of tries for login (3 tries)
better ui (more modern)
